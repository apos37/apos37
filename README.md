## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello there! You can call me Aristocles, a passionate coder with a deep-rooted love for all things tech. My coding journey began back in 1997, when Angelfire and Geocities were the gateways to the web. Over the years, Iâ€™ve transitioned from those early days into an experienced back-end website and Discord bot developer, working extensively with PHP and JS/jQuery.

## What I Do

- **WordPress Wizardry**: I focus on creating efficient solutions for the WordPress platform. You can explore my carefully maintained plugins on both the WP Plugin Repository and here on GitHub.
- **Discord Bot Development**: I develop engaging Discord bots using Discord.js. A couple of my bots serve gaming communities, and one is an extensive graphology bot designed to assist with analyzing and interpreting handwriting.

## Philosophy

Coding isnâ€™t just a profession for me; itâ€™s a never-ending learning journey. I steer clear of the know-it-all attitude because the tech landscape is always evolving, and thereâ€™s always more to learn. If youâ€™re as excited about continuous improvement as I am, weâ€™ll get along just fine.

## Collaboration

While Iâ€™m enthusiastic about small, impactful projects, my current schedule limits my availability for large-scale commitments. I thrive on collaboration, so if youâ€™ve got a manageable project or just want to chat tech, feel free to reach out!
